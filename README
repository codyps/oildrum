= File-level Encryption, the right way

Nothing here yet, just brainstorming.

== Best Practices ==

 - Use XTS mode.
 - Encrypt then MAC
 - use at least 128 bit MACs
 - encrypt configuration
 - 

== Features ==

 - Hide file layout
   - store metadata seperately
   - If we use 1 real-file per file, the number of files & appoximate size of files still disclosed
   - If we split files into blocks which are stored 1 block per real-file we obscure the number of files (potentially), but the appoximate size is still obtainable
     - size of metadata files will be predictable, some analysis of their size compared to average size should let us guess how many files there are.
